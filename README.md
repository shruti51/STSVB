# STSVB

MATLAB implementation of Spatio-Temporal Sparse Variational Bayes Framework. For more details, please refer to the paper: 

Shruti Sharma, Santanu Chaudhury and Jayadeva, "Block Sparse Variational Bayes Regression Using Matrix Variate Distributions With Application to SSVEP Detection," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3027773. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222564)

STSVB recovers block sparse signal using matrix variate gaussian scale mixture parameterized by some scalar random parameters and 
deterministic matrices to model spatio-temporal correlation.
